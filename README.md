# Lift-CEP
Lift mechanism using DLD. 

This project designs a digital logic-based lift control system using DIP switches for floor selection. Key components like the 7485 comparator, 7474 flip-flop, and 7476 JK flip-flop ensure precise direction control and movement. The system prevents unnecessary operations by storing the current floor and validating user inputs. Real-time floor displays are achieved via 7-segment modules, synchronized by a 555 timer. The result is a cost-effective, educational solution demonstrating core digital logic principles.
